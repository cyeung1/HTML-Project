<h2>Introduction to How Search Web Engines Work</h2>
<p>Web search engines are powerful software systems that are designed to enable users to search for information by typing key words, images, audio or through other means. The <br>algorithms allow the search engines to systematically browse and index the web (web crawler) thus it can maintain real-time information. The results are usually presented in a <br>columnar list of lines or pictures in a table/cell and contain a mix of webpages, articles, videos, images or other types. </p>

<p>This picture by Dr. Niraj Singhal shows how a typical web engine can constantly update its contents. The crawler access the w.w.w, downloads<br> its contents and sends it in a certain indexed format to the database which organizes the data. Users can use the search interface (website) which activates the<br> query engine. The query engine then searches the database of the information that most matches what the user has entered.</p>
